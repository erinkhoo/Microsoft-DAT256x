If you have Jupyter Notebooks with the Python 3.6 kernel installed on your computer, you can use that to complete the labs. Otherwise, go to https://notebooks.azure.com and sign up for an Azure Notebooks account, then create a library for the notebooks you will use in the labs.

You could also do the course work with Google Colab

The Jupyter notebooks used in the labs for this course are available at https://aka.ms/edx-dat256x-labs.
